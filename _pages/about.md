I am currently a forth year PhD student in the Computer Science Department at National Univeristy of Singapore, advised by [Prof. Gim Hee Lee](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/cs/people/leegh/). I received my B.E. degree from Tianjin University in 2020. My research interests are 3D scene understanding, low-shot learning and multi-modal understanding.
