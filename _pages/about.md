I am currently a forth-year PhD student in the Computer Science Department at [National Univeristy of Singapore](https://nus.edu.sg/), advised by [Prof. Gim Hee Lee](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/cs/people/leegh/). I received B.E. degree from [Tianjin University](http://www.tju.edu.cn/english/index.htm) in 2020. My primary research interest is 3D scene understanding. I am also interested in few-shot learning, learning with noisy label and multi-modal understanding.

*I am seeking a job at a company or research institute starting as early as September 2024. If you think I am a good fit, please contact me via email.*
