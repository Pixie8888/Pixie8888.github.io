I obtained PhD degree in Computer Science at [National Univeristy of Singapore](https://nus.edu.sg/). My PhD supervisor is [Prof. Gim Hee Lee](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/cs/people/leegh/). I received B.E. degree from [Tianjin University](http://www.tju.edu.cn/english/index.htm) in 2020. My research interest is mainly on 3D scene understanding.
