I am currently a forth year PhD student in the Computer Science Department at [National Univeristy of Singapore](https://nus.edu.sg/), advised by [Prof. Gim Hee Lee](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/cs/people/leegh/). I received B.E. degree from [Tianjin University](http://www.tju.edu.cn/english/index.htm) in 2020. My research interests are 3D scene understanding, low-shot learning and multi-modal understanding.
